<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>10.1 THE REVIEW
PROCESS</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Reviews can be done in many different ways. A
formal <span class=docemphasis1>group review</span>, also called an <span
class=docemphasis1>inspection</span>, is perhaps the best of these options for
identifying defects. Software inspections were first proposed by Fagan.</span><a

inspections focused on code, but over the years this technique has spread to
other work products. Today, software inspections are a recognized industry best
practice, with considerable data to prove that they improve quality and
productivity (for example, see the reports in Gilb and Graham,</span><a

lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>5</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB>). Several
books on the topic describe in great detail how inspections should be
conducted.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch10lev1sec6#ch10entry03"><sup><span

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The basic review process at Infosys is the
group review, which is similar to an inspection. A group review is an analysis
of a software work product by a group of peers following a clearly defined
process. The goals of such reviews are to improve quality by finding defects
and to improve productivity by finding defects in a cost-effective manner. In
addition, reviews provide inputs and visibility for project management into the
quality of the work products. A group review is conducted by technical people
for technical people, and the focus is on identifying problems, not resolving
them.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The group review process includes several
stages: planning, preparation and overview, a group review meeting, and rework
and follow-up. As shown in </span><a
href="http:// /JVXSL.asp?x=1&amp;mode=section&amp;sortKey=insertDate&amp;sortOrder=desc&amp;view=book&amp;xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch10lev1sec1&amp;open=true&amp;title=New%20This%20Week&amp;catid=&amp;s=1&amp;b=1&amp;f=1&amp;t=1&amp;c=1&amp;u=1#ch10fig01#ch10fig01"><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Figure 10.1</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>, these
stages are usually executed in a linear order.</span></p>

<h5 align=center style='text-align:center'><a name=ch10fig01></a><span

<p class=doctext align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0
width=500 height=186 src="064_files/image001.gif" alt="graphics/10fig01.gif"></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>In some situations, a group review may be
overkill; a more limited form of group review may be more cost-effective. At
Infosys, a one-person review, discussed later in this section, is also done.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch10lev2sec1></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>10.1.1 Planning</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The objective of the planning phase is to
prepare for the group review by selecting the group review team and scheduling
the review. The author of the work product ensures that the work product is ready
for group review and that all pertinent standards have been met. The project
manager, with the author's agreement, first selects the moderator; then, with
the moderator's agreement, the project manager selects the other reviewers. The
<span class=docemphasis1>moderator</span> has the overall responsibility of
ensuring that the review is done properly and that all steps in the review
process are followed. The <span class=docemphasis1>reviewers</span> (also
called inspectors) have the responsibility of identifying defects in the work
product. Generally, the author is also one of the reviewers; the moderator may
be a reviewer as well.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>As far as possible, no superiors should be
included because their presence might discourage the reviewers from raising
issues or errors. If the author desires, however, the project leader can also
take part.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Once the review team is selected, the author
prepares a package that is distributed for group review. This package includes
the work product to be reviewed, its specifications, and relevant checklists
and standards. Often, the specifications for the work product are the output of
the preceding phase and are needed to check the correctness of the current work
product.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch10lev2sec2></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>10.1.2 Overview and Preparation</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The purpose of the overview and preparation
phase is to deliver the package for review to the reviewers and to explain the
work product, if necessary. The material can be distributed and explained in an
initial meeting. The moderator opens this meeting with a brief statement on the
work product, the group review objectives, and, if needed, an overview of the
group review process. The author may provide a brief tutorial on the work
product, including a summary of any special considerations or areas that might
be particularly difficult to understand. During this overview, anything unique
about the project or the work product is highlighted. This step is optional and
can be omitted. In that case, the moderator simply provides a copy of the group
review package to the reviewers.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>To prepare for the group review meeting, the
reviewers then individually review (<span class=docemphasis1>self-review</span>)
the work product. Wherever the work product appears to have a defect, reviewers
make notes with explanations in a self-preparation log (described in detail in </span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch10lev1sec2#ch10lev2sec7"><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>section 10.2.1</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>). They
also record the time spent in individual review. During this review, they use
any relevant checklists, guidelines, and standards.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Ideally, this preparation step should be done
in one sitting. The recommended time for preparation is one hour for every hour
of group review meeting scheduled.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch10lev2sec3></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>10.1.3 Group Review Meeting</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The basic purpose of the group review meeting
is to come up with the final defect list; this list is based on the initial
list of defects and issues reported by the reviewers and any new ones found
during the meeting discussion.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Before the meeting is scheduled, the
moderator first checks whether all reviewers are prepared. This verification
involves a brief examination of the effort and defect data in the
self-preparation logs to confirm that sufficient time and attention have gone
into the preparation. If preparation is not adequate, the group review is
deferred until all participants are fully prepared.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>When everything is ready, the group review
meeting is held. One reviewer is designated as the scribe and another the
reader. The meeting is conducted as follows. The reader goes over the work
product line by line (or any other convenient small unit), paraphrasing each
line to the team. (Some meetings do not include paraphrasing, in which case the
reader role may not be present.) At any line, if any reviewer has previously
identified any issues or finds new issues in the meeting while listening to
others, he raises the point. There may be a discussion on the issue raised, and
other reviewers may agree or disagree with it. In any event, the author reviews
the issue under discussion and either clarifies why it is not an issue or
accepts it as a defect or open issue. The scribe records the issues and defects
identified.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>At the end of the meeting, the scribe
presents the list of open issues and defects identified during the meeting, and
it undergoes a final review by the team members. Note that defects and issues
are merely identified during the review process. It is not the purpose of the
group to identify solutions; that action is taken later by the author.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>If few modifications are required, the group
review status is &quot;accepted.&quot; If many modifications are required, a
follow-up meeting or a re-review might be necessary to verify whether the
changes have been incorporated correctly. The moderator recommends what is to
be done. Unlike a defect, which the author is responsible for fixing, the
moderator may assign issues to different persons for resolution. The assignment
is made before the meeting is closed. Sometimes, recommendations regarding
reviews in the next stages are also made. For example, in a detailed design
review, the group may recommend which code modules should undergo group reviews
in the build phase.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The moderator is in charge of the meeting and
ensures that the meeting stays focused on its basic purpose—defect
identification—and does not degenerate into a general brainstorming session or
personal attacks on the author. The moderator should undergo formal training on
how to conduct reviews or should have experience as a participant in a few
reviews. During the meeting, the moderator must make sure that all participants
contribute effectively, that everyone is heard, that agreement is reached on
the findings of the review, and that the interest level does not drop. A key
responsibility is to ensure that the focus remains on problem identification
and does not drift into problem resolution. Overall, orderly and amicable
conduct of the meeting is largely the responsibility of the moderator. After
the meeting, the moderator must make sure that all participants are satisfied,
the review report is filled and communicated, and follow-up actions are taken.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>In a review meeting, a person can be assigned
several of these logical roles, with the restrictions that the author cannot be
the moderator or the reader, and the moderator cannot be the reader. This
limitation implies that the minimum size of the group review team is three: the
author, the moderator, and the reader. These three people are also reviewers,
and one of them can act as the scribe.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch10lev2sec4></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>10.1.4 Rework and Follow-up</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The author performs rework to correct all
defects raised during the group review meeting. The author may also have to
redo the work product if the moderator recommends it. In addition, if the
reviewers have been assigned open issues, they must investigate those problems
and give the investigation results to the author and the moderator.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The author reviews the corrections with the
moderator or, if the moderator has decided one is necessary, in a re-review. The
scribe ensures that the group review report and minutes of the meetings are
communicated to the group review team. After all the issues and defects are
closed, the moderator ensures that the group review results and data are
recorded and that the group review summary form (see </span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch10lev1sec2#ch10lev2sec9"><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>section 10.2.3</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>) is
submitted to the SEPG and the project leader.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch10lev2sec5></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>10.1.5 One-Person Review</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Group review is a highly effective way of
identifying defects. Unfortunately, its cost is also high: Many people spend
time in preparation as well as in the review meeting. In addition, arranging
group review meetings is a complex logistical problem, with associated
overhead. If the work product has many defects or is a critical one, this cost
is justified. Indeed, group reviews may turn out to be a cost-effective way of
uncovering those defects. But what if the work product is relatively
straightforward, is not likely to have many defects, and is not very critical? In
this case, the group review effort may not be justified. Nevertheless, some
review of such work products may be useful—not only to detect defects but also
to gain the psychological benefits that accrue when the author knows that
someone else will be reviewing the product.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>For such situations, a one-person review may
be more appropriate. That is, for work products of medium criticality or
complexity, a one-person review may be substituted for a group review. <span
class=docemphasis1>One-person reviews</span> are formal reviews but are less
costly than group reviews because they do not involve a review team.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The process for one-person reviews is similar
to the group review process. The author, in consultation with the project
leader, identifies the reviewer. The review is scheduled, and the reviewer
receives the review package in advance. The reviewer reviews the work product
individually and prepares for the meeting with the author. The review meeting
has only two participants: the author and the reviewer. During the meeting, an
issues log and a defects log are generated. The reviewer informs the project
leader when the review is finished. The project leader is responsible for
tracking defects to closure.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch10lev2sec6></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>10.1.6 Guidelines for Reviews in Projects</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Not all work products in a project undergo
group review because it may be prohibitively expensive and may not give
commensurate returns. Following are some general guidelines for the selection
of work products for reviews.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>For a specific project, the actual criteria
and the decision regarding the work products to be reviewed are left to the
project manager and the team reviewing the work products of the early phases. Armed
with the outcome of the reviews, the team can make better decisions regarding
what to review in the rest of the project and which method to use. Because the
work products of the early part of the life cycle are critical and because
defects in them have a multiplier effect in the later stages, it is recommended
that the following work products be group reviewed:</span></p>
