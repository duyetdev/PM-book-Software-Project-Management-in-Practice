<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>7.1 CONCEPTS IN
MEASUREMENT</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The basic purpose of measurements in a
project is to effectively control the project. This section discusses some
concepts related to metrics and measurement and the basic metrics that you
should measure for controlling a project. One approach for process control is
statistical process control. This section also discusses some concepts relating
to SPC and the way SPC can be used for software.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch07lev2sec1></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>7.1.1 Metrics and Measurements</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Software metrics can be used to quantitatively
characterize various aspects of the software process or software products. <span
class=docemphasis1>Process metrics</span> quantify attributes of the software
process or the development environment, whereas <span class=docemphasis1>product
metrics</span> are measures for the software products.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch07lev1sec6#ch07entry01"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>1</span></sup></a><sup><span lang=EN-GB>,</span></sup><a

lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>2</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB> Product
metrics remain independent of the process used to produce the product. Examples
of process metrics include productivity, quality, resource metrics, defect
injection rate, and defect removal efficiency. Examples of product metrics
include size, reliability, quality (quality can be viewed as a product metric
as well as a process metric), complexity of the code, and functionality.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The use of metrics necessarily requires that
measurements be made to obtain data. For any metrics program, you must clearly
understand the goals for collecting data as well as the models that are used
for making judgments based on the data. In general, which metrics to use and
which measurements to take will depend on the project and organization goals;
you can use a framework, such as the goal-question-metric paradigm, to
determine the metrics that need to be measured.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch07lev1sec6#ch07entry03"><sup><span

lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>4</span></sup></a><span lang=EN-GB> In practice,
however, a few metrics suffice for most situations, and special metrics are
needed only for special situations. Schedule, size, effort, and defects are the
basic measurements for projects and form a stable metrics set.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch07lev1sec6#ch07entry05"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>5</span></sup></a><sup><span lang=EN-GB>,</span></sup><a

lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>6</span></sup></a></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Schedule is one of the most important metrics
because most projects are driven by schedules and deadlines. It is, however,
the easiest to measure because calendar time is usually used. Effort is the
main resource consumed in a software project. Consequently, tracking of effort
is a key activity during monitoring; it is essential for evaluating whether the
project is executing within budget. That is, this data is needed to make
statements such as &quot;The cost of the project is likely to be about 30% more
than projected earlier&quot; or &quot;The project is likely to finish within
budget.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Because defects have a direct relationship to
software quality, tracking of defects is critical for ensuring quality. A large
software project may include thousands of defects that are found by different
people at different stages. Often the person who fixes a defect is not the same
person who finds or reports it. Generally, a project manager will want to
remove most or all of the defects found before the final delivery of the
software. In such a scenario, defect reporting and closure cannot be done
informally. The use of informal mechanisms may lead to defects being found but
later forgotten, so defects end up not being removed or extra effort must be
spent in finding the defect again. Hence, at the very least, defects must be
logged and their closure tracked. For this procedure, you need information,
such as the manifestation of the defect, its location, and the names of the
person who found it and the person who closed it. Once each defect found is
logged (and later closed), analysis can focus on how many defects have been
found so far, what percentage of defects are still open, and other issues. Defect
tracking is considered one of the best practices for managing a project.</span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch07lev1sec6#ch07entry07"><sup><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>7</span></sup></a></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Merely logging defects and tracking them is
not sufficient to support other desirable analyses. To understand what
percentage of defects are caught where, you also need to record information
about the phases at which defects are detected. To understand the defect removal
efficiency of various quality control tasks and thereby improve their
performance, you must know not only where a defect is detected but also where
it was injected. In other words, for each defect logged, you should also
provide information about the phase in which the defect was introduced.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Size is another fundamental metric because
many data (for example, delivered defect density) are normalized with respect
to size. Without size data, you cannot predict performance using past data. Also,
without normalization with respect to a standard measure of size, you cannot
benchmark performance for comparison purposes. The two common measures for size
are lines of code (LOC) and function points. If you use lines of code as a
measure, productivity differs with the programming language. Function points
provide uniformity.</span></p>

how SPC concepts are used for project monitoring.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>A <span class=docemphasis1>process</span> is
used to produce output, and the quality of the output can be defined in terms
of certain quality <span class=docemphasis1>characteristics.</span> A number of
factors affect the variability in the value of these characteristics. These
factors can be classified into two categories: natural (or inherent) causes of
variability, and assignable (or special) causes. Natural causes are those that
are always present and each of which contributes to the variability. It's not
practical to control these causes unless the process itself is changed. Assignable
causes, on the other hand, are those that occur once in a while, have a larger
influence over variability in the process performance, and can be controlled. </span><a

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>A process is said to be under <span
class=docemphasis1>statistical control</span> if the variability in the quality
characteristics is due to natural causes only. The goal of SPC is to keep the
production process in statistical control.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>C<span class=docemphasis1>ontrol charts</span>
are a favorite tool for applying SPC. To build a control chart, the output of a
process is considered to be a stream of numeric values representing the values
of the characteristic of interest. Subgroups of data are taken from this
stream, and the mean values for the subgroups are plotted, giving an X-bar
chart. A <span class=docemphasis1>lower control limit</span> (LCL) and an <span
class=docemphasis1>upper control limit</span> (UCL) are established. If a point
falls outside the control limits, the large variability is considered to be due
to assignable causes. Another chart, called an R-chart, plots the range (the
difference between the minimum and maximum values) of the chosen subgroups. Control
limits are established for the R-chart, and a point falling outside these
control limits is also considered as having assignable causes.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>By convention, LCL and UCL are frequently set
at 3-sigma around the mean, where sigma is the standard deviation for data with
only normal variability (that is, variability due to natural causes). With
these limits, the probability of a <span class=docemphasis1>false alarm—</span>in
which a point with natural variability falls outside the limits—is only 0.27%.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>When the production process does not yield
the same item repeatedly, as is the case with software processes, forming
subgroups may not make sense; individual values are therefore considered. </span>For
such processes, XMR charts<a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch07lev1sec6#ch07entry09"><sup><span
style='color:#003399'>9</span></sup></a><sup>,</sup><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch07lev1sec6#ch07entry10"><sup><span
style='color:#003399'>10</span></sup></a> can be used. In an XMR chart, a
moving range of two consecutive values is considered as the range for the
R-chart. For the X-bar chart, the individual values are plotted; the control
limits are then determined using the average moving range.</p>

<p class=doctext>Note that control limits are different from specification
limits. <span class=docemphasis1>Specification limits</span> specify, based on
the requirements, the performance that is desired from the process. Control
limits, on the other hand, based on actual data from the process, determine the
actual performance capability of the process—that is, what the process actually
is capable of delivering. Clearly, if the control limits are within the
specification limits (the specification limits are wider than the control
limits), the process is capable of delivering output that will meet the
specifications most of the time. On the other hand, if the specification limit
is within the control limits, the probability of the process producing an
outcome that does not satisfy the requirements increases. Based on the relationship
between the specification limit and the control limit, the capability of a
process can be defined formally.<a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch07lev1sec6#ch07entry09"><sup><span

style='color:#003399'>10</span></sup></a></p>

<p class=doctext>You use the control charts to continuously monitor the
performance of the process and identify an out-of-control situation.
Separately, you decide what action will be taken when a point representing an
output falls outside the control limit. Generally, two types of actions are
performed:</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Rework the output so that it has acceptable characteristics—that
is, take corrective action.</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Conduct further analysis to identify the assignable causes and
eliminate them from the process—that is, take preventive actions.</p>

<p class=doctext>To employ control charts for software processes, you must
first identify the processes to which SPC can be applied. One choice is the
overall process, whose output is the software product to be delivered. The
characteristics that can be studied for the output of this process include
productivity, delivered defect density, and defect injection rate, among
others. You can obtain the values of most of these characteristics for the
output of the overall process only after the project ends, so SPC for the
overall process has limited value for project monitoring and control. Its value
lies primarily in understanding and improving the capability of the process.</p>

<p class=doctext>To control a project, you can deploy SPC for &quot;mini-processes&quot;
that are executed during the course of the project, such as the review process
or testing process. Under SPC, as soon as the process is executed, its results
can be analyzed. If required, you can then apply control in the form of
corrective or preventive actions. Through corrective actions, the out-of-limit
output is made acceptable; preventive actions help to improve execution of the
remainder of the project. <a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch10#ch10"><span
style='color:#003399'>Chapters 10</span></a> and <a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch11#ch11"><span
style='color:#003399'>11</span></a> discuss the use of SPC for monitoring
projects.</p>

<p class=doctext>Given the possibility of a large variation in performance in
software processes, it is not an easy task to identify points having only
natural variability so that you can determine the control limits. Hence, to
compute the control limits from past performance data, you must use your
judgment to determine which data points should be excluded. Furthermore, past
data should not be used blindly, and discerning management must always support
its use. For example, you cannot assume that a process has failed just because
the performance is out of the range computed from past data.<a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch07lev1sec6#ch07entry02"><sup><span

style='color:#003399'>11</span></sup></a> A more suitable approach is to use
the performance range to draw attention to a deviation and then analyze the
reasons for the deviation.</p>
