<h3><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:15.0pt;font-family:Arial'>1.2 PROJECT
MANAGEMENT AND THE CMM</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Once it is accepted that use of effective
processes can help in executing a project successfully, a question immediately
arises: What are the desirable characteristics of these processes? The CMM for
software is a framework that tries to answer this question.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The CMM for software is a framework that was
developed by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon
University by observing the best practices in software and other organizations.
Hence, the CMM reflects the collective process experience and expectations of
many companies. It specifies desired characteristics of processes without
prescribing specific processes. Thus, different processes can fulfill the
requirements of the CMM. It can be used to evaluate the software process of an
organization and to identify deficiencies.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The CMM is one of the most popular frameworks
for software process improvement (the other commonly used framework is ISO 9001</span><a

only the project management aspects, even though the CMM also covers organizational

<h4><a name=ch01lev2sec1></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>1.2.1 Overview of the CMM</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>One objective of the CMM is to distinguish
mature processes from immature, or ad hoc, processes. Immature software
processes imply that projects are executed without many guidelines, and the
outcome of a project depends largely on the capability of the team and the
project leader. On the other hand, with mature processes, a project is executed
by following defined processes. In this case, the outcome of the project is
less dependent on people and more on the processes. It follows, then, that the
more mature the processes, the more predictable the results and the more well
controlled the projects.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The range of results that can be expected in
a project when it is executed using a process is its <span class=docemphasis1>process
capability.</span> The actual result achieved in a project executed using the
process is its <span class=docemphasis1>process performance.</span> Clearly,
the process performance depends on the process capability. To consistently
improve process performance on projects, you must enhance the process
capability; the process itself must become more mature.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The path to higher maturity includes some
well-defined plateaus referred to as <span class=docemphasis1>maturity levels</span>
by the CMM. Each maturity level specifies certain characteristics for
processes, with higher maturity levels having more advanced characteristics
that are found in more mature software processes. Hence, the CMM framework
describes the key elements of software processes at different levels of
maturity. Consequently, it also specifies the path that a software process
follows in moving from immature processes to highly mature processes. This path
includes five maturity levels, as shown in </span><a

<p class=doctext align=center style='text-align:center'><img border=0

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>In level 1, the <span class=docemphasis1>initial</span>
level, a project is executed in a manner that the team and project manager see
fit. The <span class=docemphasis1>repeatable</span> level (level 2) applies
when established project management practices are employed, although
organization-wide processes may not exist. At the <span class=docemphasis1>defined</span>
level (level 3), organization-wide processes have been defined and are
regularly followed. At the <span class=docemphasis1>managed</span> level (level
4), quantitative understanding of the process capability makes it possible to
quantitatively predict and control the process performance on a project. At the
<span class=docemphasis1>optimizing</span> level (level 5), the process
capability is improved in a controlled manner and the improvement is evaluated
quantitatively.</span></p>

<p class=doctext>Each maturity level (except level 1) is characterized by <span
class=docemphasis1>key process areas</span> (KPAs), which specify the areas on
which the organization should focus to elevate its processes to that maturity
level. <a
href="http:// /JVXSL.asp?x=1&amp;mode=section&amp;sortKey=insertDate&amp;sortOrder=desc&amp;view=book&amp;xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch01lev1sec2&amp;open=true&amp;title=New%20This%20Week&amp;catid=&amp;s=1&amp;b=1&amp;f=1&amp;t=1&amp;c=1&amp;u=1#ch01fig01#ch01fig01"><span
style='color:#003399'>Figure 1.1</span></a> also shows the KPAs for the
different levels. For an organization to achieve a maturity level, it must
satisfy all the KPAs at that maturity level as well as the KPAs at all lower
maturity levels.</p>

<p class=doctext>Maintaining processes at higher levels of maturity is a
challenging task requiring commitment from the organization and a proper work
culture. Of the 900 assessments conducted between 1996 and June 2000 whose
assessment results were provided to the SEI, only 3% of the organizations were
at level 5, and another 5% were at level 4.<a

style='color:#003399'>10</span></sup></a> The rest were at level 3 or below,
with 38% at level 2 and 18% at level 3.</p>

KPAs for Project Management</span></h4>

<p class=doctext>Each KPA specifies goals that the processes of the
organization must meet to satisfy that KPA. In addition, each KPA specifies a
group of activities, called <span class=docemphasis1>key practices</span>, that
collectively satisfy the goals of that KPA. In many senses, the goals for each
KPA capture its essence. They specify the objectives that the CMM has set for
the processes relating to the KPA. To illustrate the KPAs associated with
project management, we briefly discuss here the goals of these KPAs. These
goals are taken from the CMM,<a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch01lev1sec6#ch01entry07"><sup><span
style='color:#003399'>7</span></sup></a> with some minor changes in the wording
of some goals.</p>

style='color:#003399'>Table 1.1</span></a> lists all the goals for KPAs at
level 2, showing clearly that the level 2 focus is almost exclusively on
project management. Under these goals, you create and document a project plan,
evaluate the ongoing project performance against the plan, and take actions
when the actual performance significantly deviates from the plan. Requirements
are properly documented, and changes to requirements are properly managed. All
work products are controlled, and changes to products are properly managed
through a planned configuration management plan. Reviews and audits are
performed to ensure that planned processes and standards are being followed. If
some parts of the project are subcontracted to other vendors, the subcontracted
work is also monitored properly.</p>

style='color:#003399'>Table 1.2</span></a> details the goals of three of the
seven KPAs at level 3. The other KPAs focus on organizational and process
management issues. A project in a level 3 organization uses a tailored version
of the standard process and reuses assets, data, and experience from past projects
for planning. The various groups that contribute to the project cooperate
smoothly through well-defined interfaces and mechanisms. Reviews are properly
carried out to identify defects in work products, and sufficient support for
conducting reviews and follow-up activities is provided.</p>

lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Table 1.3</span></a> <span lang=EN-GB>shows
the goals for the two KPAs at level 4. At level 4, the capability of the
organization's process is understood in quantitative terms. The process
capability is used to set quantitative goals for a project. Data on project
performance are collected on an ongoing basis and are compared with data on
past performance; if significant deviations are observed, proper corrective
actions are applied to bring the project back in control. A key aspect of level
4 is the use of statistical process control techniques on an ongoing basis so
that each activity can be evaluated and corrective action taken if needed.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The three KPAs at level 5 focus on improving
the capability of the process. Of the three KPAs, the Defect Prevention KPA is
the one that most directly affects project management. This KPA requires that
defects be prevented proactively by systematically analyzing the causes of
defects and then eliminating those causes. If defects can be prevented from
entering the software, the effort spent in removing them can be reduced,
thereby improving quality and productivity.</span></p>
