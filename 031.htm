QUANTITATIVE QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLANNING</span></h3>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Now let's consider how project managers at
Infosys use the defect prediction approach for quantitatively managing software
quality. (As discussed in </span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch10#ch10"><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Chapters 10</span></a><span lang=EN-GB> and </span><a
href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch11#ch11"><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>11</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>, projects also
use SPC at the task level.) As discussed earlier, when you plan for
quantitatively managing quality for a project, you face two key issues: first,
setting the quality goal, and second, predicting defect levels at intermediate
milestones that can be used for quantitatively monitoring progress toward the
goal. In addition, if the project goals exceed the capability of existing
processes, the project manager must plan suitable enhancements to the quality
process. Let's look at how project managers perform these three tasks at
Infosys.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch05lev2sec4></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>5.2.1 Setting the Quality Goal</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Project managers at Infosys set quality goals
during the planning stages. The <span class=docemphasis1>quality goal</span>
for a project generally is the expected number of defects found during
acceptance testing. You can set the quality goal according to what is <span
class=docemphasis1>computed</span> using past data; in this case, it is implied
that you will use the standard process, and hence standard quality results will
be expected. Two primary sources can be used for setting the quality goal: past
data from similar projects and data from the PCB.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>If you use data from similar projects, you
can estimate the number of defects found during acceptance testing of the
current project as the product of the number of defects found during acceptance
testing of the similar projects and the ratio of the estimated effort for this
project and the total effort of the similar projects.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>If you use data from the PCB, you can use any
of several methods to compute this value. If you set the quality target as the
number of defects per function point, you estimate size in function points (as
discussed earlier), and the expected number of defects is the product of the
quality figure and the estimated size. </span>The following sequence of steps
is used:</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><a
name=ch05pr01></a><span lang=EN-GB>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB><span value=1>Set the quality goal in terms of
defects per FP.</span></p>

</span>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB><span value=2>Estimate the expected productivity
level for the project.</span></p>

</span>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB><span value=3>Estimate the size in FP as
(expected productivity * estimated effort).</span></p>

</span>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB><span value=4>Estimate the number of AT defects
as (quality goal * estimated size).</span></p>

</span>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Instead of setting the quality goal in terms
of defects per function point, sometimes it is more useful to set the target in
terms of the process's defect removal efficiency. In this situation, you can
determine the number of defects to be expected during acceptance testing from
the defect injection rate, the target in-process removal efficiency, and the
estimated size. </span>The sequence of steps is as follows:</p>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><a
name=ch05pr02></a><span lang=EN-GB>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB><span value=1>Set the quality goal in terms of
defect removal efficiency.</span></p>

</span>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB><span value=2>Estimate the total number of
defects from the defect injection rate and the estimated size, or by the effort-based
defect injection rate and the effort estimate.</span></p>

</span>

<p class=doclist style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
lang=EN-GB>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB><span value=3>Estimate the number of AT defects
from the total number of defects and the quality goal.</span></p>

</span>

<h4><a name=ch05lev2sec5></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>5.2.2 Estimating Defects for Other Stages</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Once the project's quality goal is set, you
should estimate defect levels for the various quality control activities so
that you can quantitatively control the quality. The approach for estimating
defect levels for other phases is similar to the approach for estimating the
defects in acceptance testing. From the estimate of the total number of defects
that will be introduced, you forecast the defect levels for the various testing
stages by using the percentage distribution of defects as given in the PCB. Alternatively,
you can forecast defects for the various phases based on past data from similar
projects.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>At a minimum, you estimate the defects
uncovered in system and integration testing. System testing is singled out
because it is the major testing activity and the final QC activity performed
before the software is submitted to the customer. Estimating defects for system
testing and then comparing that number to the actual number of defects found
will help you determine whether the system testing has been sufficient and the
software is ready for release.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>For reviews, instead of making an explicit
prediction of the defect levels, you can use norms given in the review baseline
to evaluate the effectiveness of a review immediately after it has been
executed. These norms are determined based on SPC and allow you to evaluate the
effectiveness of each review rather than evaluating the effectiveness of a
phase. </span><a href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch10#ch10"><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Chapter 10</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>
discusses quantitatively managing reviews in more detail. Similarly, norms are
also provided for unit testing. Monitoring of unit testing is discussed further
in </span><a href="http:// /?xmlid=0-201-73721-3/ch11#ch11"><span
lang=EN-GB style='color:#003399'>Chapter 11</span></a><span lang=EN-GB>.</span></p>

<h4><a name=ch05lev2sec6></a><span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:Arial'>5.2.3 Quality Process Planning</span></h4>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>You can set a quality goal that is higher (or
lower) than the quality level of a similar project, or you can aim for the
levels achieved by the standard process. You can then determine the expected
number of defects for the higher goal by using the quality goal set for the
project. Alternatively, after determining the expected number of AT defects,
you can set the quality goal by choosing a different number of AT defects as
the target.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>If the quality goal is based on the data from
similar projects and the goal is higher than that of the similar projects, it
is unreasonable to expect that following the same process as used in the
earlier projects will achieve the higher quality goal. If the same process is
followed, the reasonable expectation is that similar quality levels will be
achieved. Hence, if a higher quality level is desired, the process must be
suitably upgraded. Similarly, if the quality goal is set higher than the
quality levels given in the PCB, it is unreasonable to expect that following
the standard process will lead to the higher quality level. Hence, a new
strategy will be needed—generally, a combination of training, prototyping,
testing, reviews, and, in particular, defect prevention. This strategy is
explicitly stated in the quality plan for the project. Here we discuss testing
and reviews, the two main quality control processes. Defect prevention planning
is discussed later in this chapter.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>Different levels of testing are deployed in a
project. You can modify the overall testing by adding or deleting some testing
steps (these steps show up as process deviations in the project management
plan). In addition, you can enhance the approach to testing by, for example,
performing a group review of the test plans and test results.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>The choice of work products to be reviewed is
generally made by the project manager. The set of documents reviewed may, in
fact, change from project to project. It can be adjusted according to the
quality goal. If a higher quality level is set, it is likely to be achieved by
having a larger number of programs group reviewed, by including a group review
of the test plans, by having a more critical review of detailed designs, and so
on. If this approach is selected, it is mentioned as the strategy for meeting
the quality goal. To further elaborate on the implications of this type of
strategy, you specify in the project plan all documents that will be reviewed
and the nature of those reviews.</span></p>

<p class=doctext><span lang=EN-GB>You can use the data in the process
capability baseline to estimate the effects of the proposed process changes on
the effort and schedule planned for the project. Frequently, once the process
changes are identified, their effects are predicted based on past experience. This
tactic is usually acceptable because the changes are generally minor.</span></p>
